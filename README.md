## As an Engineer, I have experience:
* Designing PCBs from the concept to the final product using noise reduction techniques and power distribution :electric_plug:.
* :computer: Simulating and creating PID controllers, space state pole placement, digital control systems, stability calculus and Observers.
* Using Comunication protocols lif RF, SPI, I2C, wifi, bluetooth, etc.
* Implementing Raspberry PI solutions, STM32, ESP32
* Industrial Instrumentation and sensors selection.
* Robotics and computer vision
## On the other hand as a Software developer:
* 3 years working as a fullstack developer gave me the opportunity to perform maintenance and create DBs such as ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white) and ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-005C84?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white). Use REST and Graphql protocols, and make frontend responsive designs with ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue%20js-35495E?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=4FC08D), ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-38B2AC?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white) and ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB).
* Implement machine learning algorithms to do object detection (YOLO, SSD), scene segmentation, clasification and linear regression for predictions, all of them on ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-FF6F00?style=for-the-badge&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white), ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-EE4C2C?style=for-the-badge&logo=pytorch&logoColor=white), ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-2C2D72?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white) and ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-777BB4?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white).
